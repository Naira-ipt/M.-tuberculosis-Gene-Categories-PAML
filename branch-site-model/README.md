# branch-site model
In this section we aimed to perform branch-site-model for each gene category, example 'Information pathways'. 
Branches under test for positive selection are called foreground branches, whereas all other branches on the tree are the background branchesas [Sandra √Ålvarez-Carretero et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msad041).
Here, M. tuberculosis TUN4.3_CC1 are considered as foreground branches and M. tuberculosis L4 strains as background.
